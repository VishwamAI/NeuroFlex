# Edge AI Documentation for NeuroFlex Project

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the Edge AI capabilities developed in the NeuroFlex project. It explains the design and functionality of the Edge AI components, including the model architecture, optimization techniques, and testing procedures.

## Model Architecture

The Edge AI model is implemented using the Flax library, which is built on top of JAX. The model architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by dense layers, designed to process input images of shape `(28, 28, 1)` and output a prediction for 10 classes.

### SimpleModel Class

```python
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    @nn.compact
    def __call__(self, x):
        x = nn.Conv(features=32, kernel_size=(3, 3))(x)
        x = nn.relu(x)
        x = nn.avg_pool(x, window_shape=(2, 2), strides=(2, 2))
        x = nn.Conv(features=64, kernel_size=(3, 3))(x)
        x = nn.relu(x)
        x = nn.avg_pool(x, window_shape=(2, 2), strides=(2, 2))
        x = x.reshape((x.shape[0], -1))  # Flatten the input
        x = nn.Dense(features=64)(x)
        x = nn.relu(x)
        x = nn.Dense(features=10)(x)
        return x  # Output is 2D (batch_size, num_classes)
```

## Optimization Techniques

The Edge AI model incorporates several optimization techniques to enhance performance on edge devices:

1. **Quantization**: Reduces the precision of the model's weights and activations to decrease memory usage and increase inference speed.
2. **Pruning**: Removes unnecessary connections in the neural network to reduce model size and improve efficiency.
3. **Knowledge Distillation**: Trains a smaller model (student) to mimic the behavior of a larger model (teacher), resulting in a compact yet efficient model.
4. **Federated Learning**: Enables decentralized training across multiple devices while maintaining data privacy.

## Testing Procedures

The Edge AI model is tested using the `unittest` framework to ensure its functionality and performance. The tests cover various aspects of the model, including training, inference, and optimization techniques.

### Test Cases

- **Model Training**: Verifies that the model can be trained using the provided data and labels.
- **Inference**: Ensures the model produces the correct output shape and predictions for input data.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Tests the implementation of quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation.

## Conclusion

The Edge AI capabilities developed in the NeuroFlex project demonstrate the potential for deploying efficient and responsive AI models on edge devices. The combination of model architecture and optimization techniques ensures that the models are well-suited for real-world applications, providing fast and accurate predictions while minimizing resource usage.
