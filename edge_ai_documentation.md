# Edge AI Documentation for NeuroFlex Project

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the Edge AI capabilities developed in the NeuroFlex project. It explains the design and functionality of the Edge AI components, including the model architecture, optimization techniques, and testing procedures.

## Model Architecture

The Edge AI model is implemented using the Flax library, which is built on top of JAX. The model architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by dense layers, designed to process input images of shape `(28, 28, 1)` and output a prediction for 10 classes.

### SimpleModel Class

```python
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    @nn.compact
    def __call__(self, x):
        x = nn.Conv(features=32, kernel_size=(3, 3))(x)
        x = nn.relu(x)
        x = nn.avg_pool(x, window_shape=(2, 2), strides=(2, 2))
        x = nn.Conv(features=64, kernel_size=(3, 3))(x)
        x = nn.relu(x)
        x = nn.avg_pool(x, window_shape=(2, 2), strides=(2, 2))
        x = x.reshape((x.shape[0], -1))  # Flatten the input
        x = nn.Dense(features=64)(x)
        x = nn.relu(x)
        x = nn.Dense(features=10)(x)
        return x  # Output is 2D (batch_size, num_classes)
```

## Optimization Techniques

The Edge AI model incorporates several optimization techniques to enhance performance on edge devices:

1. **Quantization**: The model's parameters are quantized to a lower precision using JAX's tree mapping capabilities, reducing memory usage and increasing inference speed without significant loss of accuracy.
2. **Pruning**: The model's parameters are pruned based on a sparsity threshold, removing unnecessary connections to reduce model size and improve computational efficiency.
3. **Knowledge Distillation**: A smaller student model is trained to mimic the behavior of a larger teacher model using a distillation loss function, resulting in a compact yet efficient model that retains the teacher's knowledge.
4. **Federated Learning**: Enables decentralized training across multiple devices while maintaining data privacy. (Implementation pending)

## Testing Procedures

The Edge AI model is tested using the `pytest` framework to ensure its functionality and performance. The tests cover various aspects of the model, including training, inference, optimization techniques, and anomaly detection.

### Test Results

- **Passed Tests**: All tests passed successfully, including those for the `AnomalyDetector` and `self_healing_mechanism`, verifying the model's training, inference, optimization, and anomaly detection capabilities.
- **Warnings**: A warning was issued regarding the `reduce_range` parameter in PyTorch, which is non-critical and does not affect the overall functionality of the model.

## Conclusion

The Edge AI capabilities developed in the NeuroFlex project demonstrate the potential for deploying efficient and responsive AI models on edge devices. The combination of model architecture and optimization techniques ensures that the models are well-suited for real-world applications, providing fast and accurate predictions while minimizing resource usage.
