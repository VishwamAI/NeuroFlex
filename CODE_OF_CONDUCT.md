[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the **NeuroFlex** project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to act in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy and kindness towards others.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at [kasinadhsarma@gmail.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality about the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.
