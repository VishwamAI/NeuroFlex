# Changes Documentation

## Utils Module

- Comprehensive error handling and logging have been added to each utility function to improve the robustness and maintainability of the module.
- Missing utility functions have been implemented to ensure all required functionalities are available.

## Model

- The `forward` method in the `MultiModalLearning` class has been updated with detailed logging to trace the data flow and ensure inputs are processed correctly as tensors.
- The logging helps identify any issues with input data types and shapes, particularly for the text modality, which was previously causing a `TypeError`.
- The `fit` method has been reviewed to ensure it processes inputs correctly, with checks for input shapes and types.
- The test suite for `test_multi_modal_learning.py` has been executed successfully, confirming that the updates resolve the previous issues and that all tests pass.

## General

- The README.md file has been updated with clearer installation instructions and a comprehensive Quick Start Guide, including BCI components and other features.
- A `quick_guide.md` file has been created in the `/home/ubuntu/NeuroFlex/docs` directory, providing an overview of NeuroFlex features and a step-by-step guide.
- The "o1_experimental" module has been developed with specific features for Orein AI and Meta AR, and documented in `/home/ubuntu/NeuroFlex/docs/o1_experimental_documentation.md`.
