## Installation

To install NeuroFlex, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv neuroflex_env
   source neuroflex_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `neuroflex_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install NeuroFlex and its dependencies:
   ```
   pip install neuroflex
   ```

   For development installation:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/NeuroFlex.git
   cd NeuroFlex
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Usage

Here are some basic usage examples for NeuroFlex components:

1. Core Neural Networks:
   ```python
   from neuroflex.core_neural_networks import TensorFlowModel, JAXModel

   # Create and use a TensorFlow model
   tf_model = TensorFlowModel(input_shape=(10,), output_dim=5, hidden_layers=[64, 32])

   # Create and use a JAX model
   jax_model = JAXModel(input_dim=10, hidden_layers=[64, 32], output_dim=5)
   ```

2. Quantum Neural Networks:
   ```python
   from neuroflex.quantum_neural_networks import QuantumNeuralNetwork

   qnn = QuantumNeuralNetwork(n_qubits=4, n_layers=2)
   ```

3. Cognitive Architectures:
   ```python
   from neuroflex.cognitive_architectures import ConsciousnessSimulation

   consciousness = ConsciousnessSimulation(features=[64, 32], output_dim=10, working_memory_size=100)
   ```

4. Edge AI:
   ```python
   from neuroflex.edge_ai import EdgeAIOptimization

   edge_optimizer = EdgeAIOptimization()
   optimized_model = edge_optimizer.optimize(model, 'quantization', bits=8)
   ```

5. Advanced Models:
   ```python
   from neuroflex.advanced_models import AdvancedTimeSeriesAnalysis

   time_series_analyzer = AdvancedTimeSeriesAnalysis()
   result = time_series_analyzer.analyze('arima', data, order=(1,1,1))
   ```

6. Self-Healing and Adaptive Algorithms:
   ```python
   # Example of self-healing in a neural network model
   issues = model.diagnose()
   if issues:
       model.self_heal()

   # Example of adaptive learning rate
   model.adjust_learning_rate()
   ```
