### Decorators

NeuroFlex now supports various decorators to enhance functionality across different frameworks:

1. `@jit`: Just-In-Time compilation for improved performance
   ```python
   @jax.jit
   def jax_function(x):
       return jax.numpy.sin(x)

   def pytorch_function(x):
       return torch.sin(x)

   @tf.function
   def tensorflow_function(x):
       return tf.math.sin(x)
   ```

2. `@vmap`: Vectorized map for efficient batch processing
   ```python
   @jax.vmap
   def jax_batch_function(x):
       return jax.numpy.sum(x, axis=-1)

   @torch.vmap
   def pytorch_batch_function(x):
       return torch.sum(x, dim=-1)
   ```

3. `@ddpm`: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (placeholder for future implementation)
   ```python

## Usage

To use NeuroFlex, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   from neuroflex import AdvancedNN, train_model, evaluate_fairness, interpret_model, data_augmentation
   ```

2. Define your model architecture:
   ```python
   model = AdvancedNN(
       features=[64, 32, 10],
       activation=nn.relu,
       dropout_rate=0.5,
       fairness_constraint=0.1,
       use_cnn=True,
       use_rnn=True,
       use_lstm=True,
       use_gan=True
   )
   ```

3. Prepare your data, including sensitive attributes for fairness considerations.

4. Apply data augmentation (optional):
   ```python
   augmented_images, _ = data_augmentation(train_data['image'])
   train_data['image'] = augmented_images
   ```

5. Train the model:
   ```python
   trained_state = train_model(model, train_data, val_data, num_epochs=10, batch_size=32,
                               learning_rate=1e-3, fairness_constraint=0.1, epsilon=0.1)
   ```

6. Evaluate fairness:
   ```python
   fairness_metrics = evaluate_fairness(trained_state, val_data)
   print("Fairness metrics:", fairness_metrics)
   ```

7. Interpret model decisions:
   ```python
   shap_values = interpret_model(model, trained_state.params, val_data['image'][:100])
   ```

8. Use the GAN component (if enabled):
   ```python
   fake_data = model.gan_block(input_data)
   ```
   Note: The GAN component is automatically used during training if `use_gan=True` in the model configuration.
