  - Debug the simulate_metabolic_pathway method to fix the value unpacking issue
  - Review and update the implementation of both methods
  - Consider updating Biopython and other dependencies if necessary
  - Add proper error handling and input validation to both methods
- **Next Steps**:
  - Investigate potential changes in the Biopython library that might have affected the IsoelectricPoint functionality
  - Review the metabolic pathway simulation algorithm to ensure correct value unpacking
  - Once fixes are implemented, remove skip markers and re-run tests
  - If issues persist, consider refactoring the affected methods or exploring alternative approaches

  - test_prepare_features
  - test_predict_structure
  - test_get_plddt_scores
  - test_get_predicted_aligned_error
- **Reasons**:
  - Mocking issues with AlphaFold dependencies
  - Difficulties in setting up and testing the AlphaFold model
  - Challenges in simulating feature preparation and structure prediction
- **Actions**:
  - Investigate AlphaFold setup process and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
  - Improve mocking of AlphaFold dependencies in tests
  - Review and refactor the AlphaFold integration implementation
  - Consider creating a simplified mock AlphaFold model for testing purposes
  - Implement better error handling and logging in the AlphaFold integration module

### Performance Issues
- Multiple warnings about "Line search cannot locate an adequate point after MAXLS function and gradient evaluations"
- Actions:
  - Investigate and optimize performance-critical sections of the code
  - Review and refine optimization algorithms used in the project

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize fixing critical errors, starting with Bioinformatics Integration and Synthetic Biology Insights
2. Address dependency and import issues across all modules
3. Review and update test cases to ensure proper error handling and assertions
4. Implement fixes for Google Integration models
5. Configure TensorFlow to disable eager execution for ART Integration

## Overall Statistics
- Total tests: 161
- Passed: 125
- Failed: 5
- Skipped: 31
- Warnings: 34

While the number of passed tests remains high, the increase in failed and skipped tests, along with new warnings, indicates areas that need immediate attention to improve the overall robustness of the NeuroFlex project.
