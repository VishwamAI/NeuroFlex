# LSTM Network Fix Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to resolve the LSTM network failure in the NeuroFlex project. The primary focus was on correcting the initialization of the `LSTMCell` in the `LSTMNetwork` class within the `neuroscience_models.py` file.

## Issue Identified
The test for the LSTM network was failing due to an incorrect initialization of the `LSTMCell`. The error message indicated that the `__init__()` method received an unexpected keyword argument 'features'.

## Changes Made
1. **LSTMCell Initialization:**
   - Removed the `features` keyword from the `LSTMCell` initialization.
   - Used the `initialize_carry` method to correctly initialize the hidden state with the appropriate dimensions.

2. **Code Update:**
   - The `LSTMNetwork` class was updated to reflect these changes, ensuring that the LSTM cell is initialized and used correctly within the `__call__` method.

## Verification
- The test case `test_lstm_network` in `test_neuroscience_models.py` was run successfully, confirming that the changes resolved the issue.

## Future Considerations
- Regularly review the Flax documentation for any updates or changes in API usage.
- Ensure that all neural network components are tested thoroughly to catch similar issues early in the development process.

This documentation serves as a reference for the steps taken to resolve the LSTM network failure and provides guidance for maintaining the project's stability in the future.
