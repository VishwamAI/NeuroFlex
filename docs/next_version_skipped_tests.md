# Skipped Tests for Next Version

This document lists the tests that have been skipped in the current version of NeuroFlex. These tests are considered pre-fixes for the next model version and should be addressed in future development.

## Google Integration

### test_create_cnn_model
- **Reason**: AttributeError: "CNN" object has no attribute "num_classes"
- **Action Required**: Review and update CNN implementation in GoogleIntegration class

### test_create_rnn_model
- **Reason**: flax.errors.TransformTargetError: Linen transformations must be applied to module classes
- **Action Required**: Ensure RNN model is properly defined as a Flax module

### test_create_transformer_model
- **Reason**: AssertionError: Memory dimension must be divisible by number of heads
- **Action Required**: Adjust transformer model architecture to ensure compatibility with input dimensions

## ART Integration

### test_set_model (for TensorFlow models)
- **Reason**: ValueError: TensorFlow is executing eagerly. Please disable eager execution.
- **Action Required**: Configure TensorFlow to disable eager execution in the test setup

## Edge AI Optimization

### test_quantize_model
- **Reason**: Test is failing and needs to be fixed
- **Action Required**: Review quantization implementation and test assertions

### test_self_heal
- **Reason**: Test is failing and needs to be fixed
- **Action Required**: Investigate self-healing mechanism and update test expectations

### test_optimize
- **Reason**: Test is failing due to assertion error and needs to be fixed
- **Action Required**: Review optimization process and update test assertions

## AlphaFold Integration

### test_setup_model
- **Reason**: ValueError: Failed to set up AlphaFold model: Failed to test AlphaFold model
- **Action Required**: Investigate AlphaFold setup process and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize fixing critical errors, starting with Edge AI Optimization and AlphaFold Integration
2. Address dependency and import issues across all modules
3. Review and update test cases to ensure proper error handling and assertions
4. Implement fixes for Google Integration models
5. Re-run tests after each major fix to track progress
