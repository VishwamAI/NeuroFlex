## Usage Examples

### Core Neural Networks

```python
from NeuroFlex.core_neural_networks import HybridNeuralNetwork

# Create a hybrid model that can use different backends
model = HybridNeuralNetwork(input_size=10, hidden_size=20, output_size=5, framework='jax')

# Train the model
model.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, learning_rate=0.01)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.forward(X_test)
```

### Reinforcement Learning

```python
from NeuroFlex.reinforcement_learning import Agent, EnvironmentIntegration

env = EnvironmentIntegration("CartPole-v1")
agent = Agent(state_size=env.observation_space.shape[0], action_size=env.action_space.n)

for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    for step in range(500):
        action = agent.get_action(state)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        agent.learn(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
        if done:
            break
```

### Quantum Neural Networks

```python
from NeuroFlex.quantum_neural_networks import QuantumNeuralNetwork, QNNTrainer

qnn = QuantumNeuralNetwork(n_qubits=4, n_layers=2)
trainer = QNNTrainer(qnn)

trainer.train(train_data, train_labels, n_epochs=100)
```

```python
from NeuroFlex.ai_ethics import EthicalFramework, SelfFixingAlgorithm

ethical_framework = EthicalFramework()
self_fixing_algo = SelfFixingAlgorithm(initial_algorithm)

result = self_fixing_algo.execute(input_data)
if ethical_framework.evaluate_action(result):
    print("Action is ethically sound")
else:
    print("Action requires ethical review")
