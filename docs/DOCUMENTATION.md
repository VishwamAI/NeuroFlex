## Installation
```bash
pip install neuroflex
```

## Quick Start Guide
1. Import NeuroFlex:
```python
from neuroflex import NeuroFlex, train_model
```

2. Define your model:
```python
model = NeuroFlex(
    features=[64, 32, 10],
    use_cnn=True,
    use_rnn=True,
    backend='jax'
)
```

3. Train your model:
```python
trained_state, trained_model = train_model(
    model, train_data, val_data,
    num_epochs=10, batch_size=32, learning_rate=1e-3
)
```

## Advanced Usage
For detailed examples of advanced usage, including quantum computing, bioinformatics integration, and ethical AI components, please refer to the [Advanced Usage Guide](advanced_usage.md).

## Security Features
NeuroFlex includes advanced security features to protect against threats and ensure model integrity:

- Threat Detection: Utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to detect potential threats.
- Adversarial Attack Mitigation: Implements strategies to mitigate adversarial attacks.
- Model Drift Detection: Monitors and corrects model drift to maintain performance.

For more details on security features, see the [Security Documentation](security.md).
