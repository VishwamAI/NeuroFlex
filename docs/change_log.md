# Change Log

## Fixes for CI/CD Pipeline and Dependency Issues

### Overview
This document outlines the changes made to resolve issues with the CI/CD pipeline and dependency management in the NeuroFlex project. The primary focus was on ensuring the 'mne' module and other dependencies were correctly installed and that the CI/CD pipeline functioned without errors.

### Changes Made

1. **Dependency Installation:**
   - Verified that the 'mne' module was listed in the `requirements.txt` file with the correct version (1.8.0).
   - Ensured all dependencies were installed locally to confirm the environment setup.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:**
   - Recreated the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to ensure the CI/CD pipeline is correctly set up with Python 3.10 and necessary dependencies.
   - Reviewed the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to ensure the installation of all required packages, including 'mne'.
   - Confirmed that the pipeline uses Python 3.10, matching the local development environment.

3. **Local Testing:**
   - Ran pytest locally to verify that all tests passed successfully.
   - Addressed warnings related to convergence and boundary effects, which are common in signal processing.

4. **Communication:**
   - Provided the user with the full output of the dependency installation for reference.
   - Ensured the user was informed about the successful local test results and the expected CI/CD pipeline behavior.

### Future Considerations
- Regularly update the `requirements.txt` file to reflect any changes in dependencies.
- Monitor the CI/CD pipeline for any new issues that may arise due to updates in dependencies or changes in the codebase.
- Consider automating dependency updates and testing to streamline the development process.

This change log serves as a reference for the steps taken to resolve the current issues and provides guidance for maintaining the project's stability in the future.
