pip install neuroflex
```

Then, import the necessary components:

```python
from neuroflex.cognitive_architectures import ConsciousnessSimulation
```

## 4.2 Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to create and use a ConsciousnessSimulation:

```python
# Create a ConsciousnessSimulation instance
consciousness = ConsciousnessSimulation(features=[64, 32], output_dim=10, working_memory_size=100)

# Use the consciousness simulation (assuming 'input_data' is your input)
output = consciousness(input_data)
```

## 4.3 Overview

The Cognitive Architectures module in NeuroFlex implements advanced cognitive models that simulate various aspects of human-like information processing and decision-making. This module integrates concepts from cognitive science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence to create a flexible and powerful framework for building intelligent systems.

Key features of the Cognitive Architectures module include:

- Integration of Global Workspace Theory
- Advanced thinking patterns and decision-making processes
- Self-healing mechanisms and adaptive algorithms
- Modular design for easy extension and customization

This chapter will explore the core components, implementation details, and usage of the Cognitive Architectures module in NeuroFlex.

## 4.4 Core Components

The Cognitive Architectures module consists of several key components that work together to simulate complex cognitive processes:

1. Sensory Processing
2. Consciousness Simulation
3. Feedback Mechanisms
4. Working Memory
5. Advanced Thinking Patterns

Each of these components is implemented as a separate class or module, allowing for modular design and easy customization.

## 4.5 Global Workspace Theory Integration

One of the central concepts in the Cognitive Architectures module is the integration of Global Workspace Theory (GWT). GWT proposes that consciousness emerges from a global workspace where different cognitive processes compete and collaborate.

In NeuroFlex, GWT is implemented through the `ConsciousnessSimulation` class, which manages the flow of information between different cognitive components and simulates the emergence of conscious thought.

### 4.5.1 Implementation Details

The `ConsciousnessSimulation` class incorporates several key aspects of Global Workspace Theory:

1. **Global Workspace**: Implemented as a central hub for information processing, represented by the `working_memory` attribute.

2. **Competition and Collaboration**: Various cognitive processes compete for access to the global workspace through attention mechanisms.

3. **Broadcast Mechanism**: Information in the global workspace is broadcast to other cognitive modules, simulated by the `generate_thought` method.

4. **Attention**: Implemented using multi-head attention mechanisms to focus on relevant information.

5. **Dynamic Access**: The content of the global workspace is continuously updated based on the current cognitive state and sensory inputs.

Here's a simplified example of how GWT is implemented in the `ConsciousnessSimulation` class:

```python
class ConsciousnessSimulation(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, features, output_dim, working_memory_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.working_memory = self.variable('working_memory', 'current_state', jnp.zeros((1, working_memory_size)))
        # ... other initializations ...

    def __call__(self, x):
        # Process input through various cognitive components
        cognitive_state = self.process_input(x)

        # Update global workspace (working memory)
        self.update_global_workspace(cognitive_state)

        # Broadcast information from global workspace
        conscious_thought = self.generate_thought(self.working_memory.value)

        return conscious_thought

    def update_global_workspace(self, cognitive_state):
        # Implement competition and collaboration mechanisms
        attention_output = self.apply_attention(cognitive_state, self.working_memory.value)
        self.working_memory.value = self.update_memory(attention_output)

    def generate_thought(self, global_workspace):
        # Broadcast information from global workspace to other modules
        thought = self.broadcast_mechanism(global_workspace)
        return thought
```

This implementation allows for the simulation of conscious processes by managing the flow of information through a central workspace, aligning with the principles of Global Workspace Theory.

## 4.6 Usage Guide and Examples

This section provides detailed examples of creating, training, and using a ConsciousnessSimulation instance, as well as demonstrating its self-healing capabilities.

### 4.6.1 Creating and Initializing a ConsciousnessSimulation

To create a ConsciousnessSimulation instance, you need to specify the features, output dimension, and working memory size:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from neuroflex.cognitive_architectures import ConsciousnessSimulation

# Define the parameters
features = [64, 32]
output_dim = 10
working_memory_size = 100

# Create the ConsciousnessSimulation instance
consciousness = ConsciousnessSimulation(features, output_dim, working_memory_size)

# Initialize the model parameters
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
params = consciousness.init(key, jnp.ones((1, features[0])))
```

### 4.6.2 Training the Cognitive Model

To train the ConsciousnessSimulation model, you need to define a loss function and use an optimizer. Here's an example of how to train the model:

```python
import optax

# Define a simple loss function (e.g., mean squared error)
def loss_fn(params, x, y):
    pred = consciousness.apply(params, x)
    return jnp.mean((pred - y) ** 2)

# Create an optimizer
optimizer = optax.adam(learning_rate=0.001)
opt_state = optimizer.init(params)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    # Assume x_train and y_train are your training data
    loss, grads = jax.value_and_grad(loss_fn)(params, x_train, y_train)
    updates, opt_state = optimizer.update(grads, opt_state)
    params = optax.apply_updates(params, updates)

    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss}")
```

### 4.6.3 Performing Inference

Once the model is trained, you can use it for inference:

```python
# Assume x_test is your input data for inference
predictions = consciousness.apply(params, x_test)
print("Predictions:", predictions)
```

### 4.6.4 Demonstrating Self-Healing Capabilities

The ConsciousnessSimulation class includes self-healing mechanisms. Here's how to use them:

```python
# Check the model's performance
performance = consciousness.evaluate_performance(params, x_test, y_test)

# If performance is below a threshold, trigger self-healing
if performance < consciousness.performance_threshold:
    print("Initiating self-healing process...")
    new_params = consciousness.self_heal(params, x_train, y_train)

    # Check performance after self-healing
    new_performance = consciousness.evaluate_performance(new_params, x_test, y_test)
    print(f"Performance before self-healing: {performance}")
    print(f"Performance after self-healing: {new_performance}")
```

### 4.6.5 Integration with Other NeuroFlex Components

The ConsciousnessSimulation can be integrated with other NeuroFlex components. For example, you can use it as part of a larger cognitive architecture:

```python
from neuroflex.core_neural_networks import PyTorchModel
from neuroflex.reinforcement_learning import RLAgent

class AdvancedCognitiveSystem:
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        self.consciousness = ConsciousnessSimulation([64, 32], output_dim, 100)
        self.perception = PyTorchModel(input_dim, 64, [128, 64])
        self.decision_making = RLAgent(64, output_dim)

    def process(self, input_data):
        perceptual_output = self.perception(input_data)
        conscious_state = self.consciousness(perceptual_output)
        action = self.decision_making.select_action(conscious_state)
        return action

# Usage
cognitive_system = AdvancedCognitiveSystem(input_dim=100, output_dim=10)
action = cognitive_system.process(input_data)
```

This example demonstrates how the ConsciousnessSimulation can be combined with other neural network models and reinforcement learning agents to create a more complex cognitive system.

By following these examples, you can effectively use the Cognitive Architectures module in NeuroFlex to create advanced AI systems that simulate aspects of human cognition, including consciousness, attention, and decision-making processes.
