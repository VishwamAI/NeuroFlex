## 6.2 Overview

The Quantum Neural Networks module in NeuroFlex integrates quantum computing principles with classical neural networks, providing a powerful framework for quantum machine learning. This module leverages PennyLane and JAX to create hybrid quantum-classical models with advanced features such as self-healing mechanisms and adaptive algorithms.

## 6.3 Key Components

The core of the Quantum Neural Networks module is the `QuantumNeuralNetwork` class, which implements a variational quantum circuit that can be used as a quantum neural network. Key components include:

1. Quantum Circuit Design
2. Input Encoding Methods
3. Variational Layers
4. Measurement Operations
5. Self-Healing Mechanisms
6. Adaptive Learning

## 6.3 Implementation Details

### 6.3.1 Quantum Circuit Design

The quantum circuit is designed using PennyLane, a software framework for quantum machine learning. The circuit structure is defined in the `circuit` method:

```python
def circuit(self, inputs: jnp.ndarray, weights: jnp.ndarray) -> List[qml.measurements.ExpectationMP]:
    # Encode input data
    self.encoding_method(inputs)

    # Apply variational quantum layers
    for layer in range(self.n_layers):
        self.variational_layer(weights[layer])

    # Apply entangling layer
    self.entangling_layer()

    # Measure the output
    return [qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(i)) for i in range(self.n_qubits)] + \
           [qml.expval(qml.PauliX(i)) for i in range(self.n_qubits)]
```

### 6.3.2 Input Encoding Methods

The module supports multiple methods for encoding classical data into quantum states:

1. Amplitude Encoding:
```python
def amplitude_encoding(self, inputs: jnp.ndarray) -> None:
    qml.QubitStateVector(inputs, wires=range(self.n_qubits))
```

2. Angle Encoding:
```python
def angle_encoding(self, inputs: jnp.ndarray) -> None:
    for i, inp in enumerate(inputs):
        qml.RY(inp, wires=i)
```

### 6.3.3 Variational Layers

The variational layers apply parameterized quantum operations:

```python
def variational_layer(self, weights: jnp.ndarray) -> None:
    for i in range(self.n_qubits):
        qml.Rot(*weights[i, :3], wires=i)
        qml.RZ(weights[i, 3], wires=i)
    for i in range(self.n_qubits - 1):
        qml.CNOT(wires=[i, i + 1])
    qml.CRZ(weights[0, 4], wires=[0, self.n_qubits - 1])
```

### 6.3.4 Hybrid Quantum-Classical Computation

The module supports hybrid quantum-classical computation:

```python
def quantum_classical_hybrid(self, inputs: jnp.ndarray, weights: jnp.ndarray, classical_layer: Callable) -> jnp.ndarray:
    quantum_output = self.forward(inputs, weights)
    return classical_layer(quantum_output)
```

## 6.4 Self-Healing Mechanisms

The Quantum Neural Networks module incorporates self-healing mechanisms to ensure robust performance:

```python
def self_heal(self, inputs: jnp.ndarray, weights: jnp.ndarray):
    issues = self.diagnose()
    if issues:
        logging.info(f"Self-healing triggered. Issues: {issues}")
        for attempt in range(self.max_healing_attempts):
            self.adjust_learning_rate()
            new_weights = self.reinitialize_weights()
            new_performance = self.evaluate_performance(inputs, new_weights)
            if new_performance > self.performance_threshold:
                logging.info(f"Self-healing successful. New performance: {new_performance:.4f}")
                return new_weights
        logging.warning("Self-healing unsuccessful after maximum attempts")
    return weights
```

## 6.5 Adaptive Learning

The module implements adaptive learning rate adjustment:

```python
def adjust_learning_rate(self):
    if len(self.performance_history) >= 2:
        if self.performance_history[-1] > self.performance_history[-2]:
            self.learning_rate *= 1.05
        else:
            self.learning_rate *= 0.95
    self.learning_rate = max(min(self.learning_rate, 0.1), 1e-5)
    logging.info(f"Adjusted learning rate to {self.learning_rate:.6f}")
```

## 6.6 Integration with NeuroFlex

The Quantum Neural Networks module can be integrated with other NeuroFlex components, such as the Core Neural Networks module, to create advanced hybrid quantum-classical models. This integration allows for the development of sophisticated AI systems that leverage both quantum and classical computing paradigms.

## 6.7 Conclusion

The Quantum Neural Networks module in NeuroFlex provides a powerful framework for quantum machine learning, combining the advantages of quantum computing with classical neural networks. By incorporating self-healing mechanisms and adaptive algorithms, it offers a robust and flexible solution for developing cutting-edge quantum AI applications.

## 6.8 Usage Examples

### 6.8.1 Creating and Training a Quantum Neural Network

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
from neuroflex.quantum_neural_networks import QuantumNeuralNetwork

# Create a Quantum Neural Network
n_qubits = 4
n_layers = 2
qnn = QuantumNeuralNetwork(n_qubits=n_qubits, n_layers=n_layers)

# Prepare training data
n_samples = 100
X_train = jnp.random.normal(size=(n_samples, n_qubits))
y_train = jnp.random.choice([0, 1], size=(n_samples,))

# Initialize weights
init_weights = qnn.initialize_weights()

# Define a simple classical layer
def classical_layer(x):
    return jnp.sum(x)

# Train the quantum-classical hybrid model
for epoch in range(50):
    loss = 0
    for x, y in zip(X_train, y_train):
        quantum_output = qnn.forward(x, init_weights)
        hybrid_output = qnn.quantum_classical_hybrid(x, init_weights, classical_layer)
        loss += (hybrid_output - y)**2

    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss/n_samples:.4f}")

    # Update weights using gradient descent (simplified)
    grad = qnn.compute_gradient(X_train, y_train, init_weights, classical_layer)
    init_weights -= 0.01 * grad

print("Training completed.")

### 6.8.2 Inference and Self-Healing

# Perform inference
x_test = jnp.random.normal(size=(n_qubits,))
prediction = qnn.quantum_classical_hybrid(x_test, init_weights, classical_layer)
print(f"Prediction for test input: {prediction}")

# Demonstrate self-healing
issues = qnn.diagnose()
if issues:
    print(f"Detected issues: {issues}")
    new_weights = qnn.self_heal(X_train, init_weights)
    print("Model has been self-healed")

    # Check performance after self-healing
    new_prediction = qnn.quantum_classical_hybrid(x_test, new_weights, classical_layer)
    print(f"Prediction after self-healing: {new_prediction}")

# Demonstrate adaptive learning
qnn.adjust_learning_rate()
print(f"Adjusted learning rate: {qnn.learning_rate}")
```

This example demonstrates how to create, train, and use a Quantum Neural Network in NeuroFlex. It covers the basic workflow, including data preparation, training loop, inference, self-healing, and adaptive learning rate adjustment. Users can extend this example to more complex quantum circuits and hybrid architectures based on their specific use cases.
