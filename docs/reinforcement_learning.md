# 3. Reinforcement Learning

## 3.1 Overview

The Reinforcement Learning (RL) module in NeuroFlex provides a comprehensive implementation of advanced RL algorithms, including adaptive mechanisms and self-healing capabilities. This module is designed to create robust and flexible RL agents that can learn and adapt in complex environments.

## 3.2 Key Components

### 3.2.1 RLAgent

The `RLAgent` class is the core component of the RL module, implementing a flexible architecture for various RL algorithms.

#### Key Features:
- Modular architecture with separate actor and critic networks
- Support for different action spaces (discrete and continuous)
- Integration with PyTorch for efficient computation
- Self-healing and adaptive learning mechanisms

#### Implementation:

```python
class RLAgent(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, observation_dim: int, action_dim: int, features: List[int] = [256, 256, 256]):
        super(RLAgent, self).__init__()
        self.observation_dim = observation_dim
        self.action_dim = action_dim
        self.features = features
        self.actor = Actor(self.action_dim, [self.observation_dim] + self.features)
        self.critic = Critic([self.observation_dim] + self.features)
        # ... (initialization of other attributes)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.actor(x), self.critic(x)

    # ... (other methods)
```

### 3.2.2 RLEnvironment

The `RLEnvironment` class provides a wrapper for OpenAI Gym environments, ensuring compatibility with the NeuroFlex RL agents.

```python
class RLEnvironment:
    def __init__(self, env_name: str, seed: int = 42):
        self.env = gym.make(env_name)
        self.observation_space = self.env.observation_space
        self.action_space = self.env.action_space
        # ... (initialization of other attributes)

    def reset(self) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict]:
        observation, info = self.env.reset(seed=self.seed)
        return torch.tensor(observation, dtype=torch.float32), info

    def step(self, action: int) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, float, bool, bool, Dict]:
        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = self.env.step(action)
        # ... (processing of step results)
        return torch.tensor(obs, dtype=torch.float32), reward, done, truncated, info

    # ... (other methods)
```

## 3.3 Training and Optimization

The RL module includes advanced training algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), with built-in optimization techniques.

### 3.3.1 PPO Implementation

```python
def train_rl_agent(agent: RLAgent, env: RLEnvironment, num_episodes: int, max_steps: int, **kwargs):
    # ... (PPO training loop implementation)
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        for step in range(max_steps):
            action, log_prob = agent.select_action(observation)
            next_observation, reward, done, truncated, _ = env.step(action.item())
            # ... (update buffer, compute advantages, etc.)

        # Perform PPO update
        for _ in range(n_epochs):
            for mini_batch in get_minibatches(data, batch_size):
                policy_loss, value_loss, kl, entropy = update_ppo(agent, mini_batch)
                # ... (logging and early stopping checks)

    # ... (return trained agent and training info)
```

## 3.4 Self-Healing and Adaptive Mechanisms

The RL module incorporates self-healing and adaptive mechanisms to ensure robust performance and continuous improvement of the agents.

### 3.4.1 Performance Monitoring

```python
def diagnose(agent: RLAgent) -> List[str]:
    issues = []
    if agent.performance < PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD:
        issues.append(f"Low performance: {agent.performance:.4f}")
    if (time.time() - agent.last_update) > UPDATE_INTERVAL:
        issues.append(f"Long time since last update: {(time.time() - agent.last_update) / 3600:.2f} hours")
    # ... (other diagnostic checks)
    return issues
```

### 3.4.2 Self-Healing Process

```python
def self_heal(agent: RLAgent, env: RLEnvironment):
    issues = diagnose(agent)
    if issues:
        logging.info(f"Self-healing triggered. Issues: {issues}")
        for attempt in range(MAX_HEALING_ATTEMPTS):
            agent.adjust_learning_rate()
            # ... (apply healing strategies)
            new_performance = simulate_performance(agent, env)
            if new_performance >= PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD:
                logging.info(f"Self-healing successful after {attempt + 1} attempts.")
                agent.performance = new_performance
                return
    # ... (handle unsuccessful healing)
```

## 3.5 Integration with NeuroFlex

The RL module is designed to integrate seamlessly with other components of the NeuroFlex framework, allowing for the creation of advanced AI systems that combine RL with other machine learning techniques.

```python
class NeuroFlex:
    def __init__(self, features, use_rl=False, rl_agent=None, ...):
        # ...
        self.use_rl = use_rl
        self.rl_agent = rl_agent or RLAgent
        # ...

    def train_rl(self, env_name: str, num_episodes: int, max_steps: int):
        env = RLEnvironment(env_name)
        agent = self.rl_agent(env.observation_space.shape[0], env.action_space.n)
        trained_agent, training_info = train_rl_agent(agent, env, num_episodes, max_steps)
        return trained_agent, training_info

    # ... (other methods)
```

## 3.6 Conclusion

The Reinforcement Learning module in NeuroFlex provides a powerful and flexible framework for implementing advanced RL algorithms with self-healing and adaptive capabilities. By leveraging PyTorch and integrating with other NeuroFlex components, it enables the development of sophisticated AI systems that can learn and adapt in complex environments.

## 3.7 Adaptive Algorithms

The RL module incorporates adaptive algorithms to improve learning efficiency and performance over time. These algorithms dynamically adjust hyperparameters and learning strategies based on the agent's performance and environmental feedback.

### 3.7.1 Adaptive Learning Rate

The `RLAgent` class implements an adaptive learning rate mechanism:

```python
def adjust_learning_rate(self):
    if len(self.performance_history) >= 2:
        if self.performance_history[-1] > self.performance_history[-2]:
            self.learning_rate *= 1.05
        else:
            self.learning_rate *= 0.95
    self.learning_rate = max(min(self.learning_rate, 0.1), 1e-5)
    logging.info(f"Adjusted learning rate to {self.learning_rate:.6f}")
```

This method adjusts the learning rate based on recent performance, allowing the agent to adapt its learning speed to the current training phase.

## 3.8 Self-Healing Mechanisms

Self-healing mechanisms in the RL module ensure robustness and continuous improvement of the agents. These mechanisms include performance monitoring, diagnostics, and adaptive strategies.

### 3.8.1 Performance Monitoring and Diagnostics

The `diagnose` method in the `RLAgent` class continuously monitors the agent's performance:

```python
def diagnose(self) -> List[str]:
    issues = []
    if self.performance < self.performance_threshold:
        issues.append(f"Low performance: {self.performance:.4f}")
    if (time.time() - self.last_update) > self.update_interval:
        issues.append(f"Long time since last update: {(time.time() - self.last_update) / 3600:.2f} hours")
    if len(self.performance_history) > 5 and all(p < self.performance_threshold for p in self.performance_history[-5:]):
        issues.append("Consistently low performance")
    return issues
```

### 3.8.2 Self-Healing Process

The `self_heal` method implements the self-healing process:

```python
def self_heal(self, env: RLEnvironment):
    issues = self.diagnose()
    if issues:
        logging.info(f"Self-healing triggered. Issues: {issues}")
        for attempt in range(self.max_healing_attempts):
            self.adjust_learning_rate()
            # Apply healing strategies
            new_performance = self.simulate_performance(env)
            if new_performance >= self.performance_threshold:
                logging.info(f"Self-healing successful after {attempt + 1} attempts.")
                self.performance = new_performance
                return
    # Handle unsuccessful healing
```

This process attempts to improve the agent's performance through techniques such as learning rate adjustment and performance simulation.

## 3.9 Integration with Other NeuroFlex Components

The RL module is designed to integrate seamlessly with other components of the NeuroFlex framework, allowing for the creation of advanced AI systems that combine RL with other machine learning techniques.

### 3.9.1 Integration with Core Neural Networks

RL agents can leverage the neural network architectures provided by the Core Neural Networks module:

```python
from NeuroFlex.core_neural_networks import PyTorchModel

class AdvancedRLAgent(RLAgent):
    def __init__(self, observation_dim, action_dim, hidden_layers):
        super().__init__(observation_dim, action_dim)
        self.policy_network = PyTorchModel(observation_dim, action_dim, hidden_layers)
        self.value_network = PyTorchModel(observation_dim, 1, hidden_layers)
```

### 3.9.2 Integration with Cognitive Architectures

RL agents can be incorporated into more complex cognitive architectures:

```python
from NeuroFlex.cognitive_architectures import CognitiveArchitecture

class RLEnhancedCognitiveArchitecture(CognitiveArchitecture):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)
        self.rl_agent = RLAgent(config['observation_dim'], config['action_dim'])

    def make_decision(self, state):
        high_level_decision = super().make_decision(state)
        rl_action = self.rl_agent.select_action(state)
        return self.combine_decisions(high_level_decision, rl_action)
```

This integration allows for the development of sophisticated AI systems that combine the strengths of reinforcement learning with other cognitive capabilities.
