## Installation

To install NeuroFlex, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.9 or later installed.
2. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv neuroflex-env
   source neuroflex-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `neuroflex-env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install NeuroFlex using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install neuroflex
   ```
4. If you encounter any issues, ensure that your pip is up to date:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Import NeuroFlex**

```python
from NeuroFlex.core_neural_networks.advanced_nn import NeuroFlexNN, train_model, create_neuroflex_nn
from NeuroFlex.bci_integration import BCIIntegration
```

2. **Define Your Model**

```python
model = create_neuroflex_nn(
    features=[128, 64, 32, 10],
    input_shape=(1, 28, 28, 1),
    output_shape=(1, 10),
    use_cnn=True,
)
```

3. **Integrate BCI Components**

```python
bci_integration = BCIIntegration(model)
bci_integration.setup_bci()
```

4. **Train Your Model**

```python
trained_state, trained_model = train_model(
    model, train_data, val_data,
    num_epochs=20,
    batch_size=32,
    learning_rate=1e-3
)
```

5. **Make Predictions**

```python
predictions = trained_model(test_data)
```

6. **Evaluate Model Performance**

```python
accuracy = evaluate_model(trained_model, test_data, test_labels)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}%")
```

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the NeuroFlex features and how to get started with the project.
