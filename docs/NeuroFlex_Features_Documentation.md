from NeuroFlex.neuromorphic_computing import SpikingNeuralNetwork
import jax.numpy as jnp

# Create a spiking neural network
snn = SpikingNeuralNetwork(num_neurons=[64, 32, 10])

# Example input (can be 1D or 2D)
input_data = jnp.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8]])

# Initialize the network
rng = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
params = snn.init(rng, input_data)

# Run the network
output, membrane_potentials = snn.apply(params, input_data)
print("SNN output:", output)
print("Membrane potentials:", membrane_potentials)
