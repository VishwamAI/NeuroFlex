## Introduction

NeuroFlex is an advanced neural network framework that integrates various cutting-edge techniques, including reinforcement learning, generative AI, and brain-computer interface technologies. We appreciate all forms of contributions, including but not limited to:

- Bug fixes
- Feature implementations
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Test case additions

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork the NeuroFlex repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NeuroFlex.git
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv neuroflexenv
   source neuroflexenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `neuroflexenv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Coding Standards and Best Practices

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules.
- Maintain a test coverage of at least 80% for new code.
- Use type hints to improve code readability and catch potential errors.
- Keep functions and methods small and focused on a single task.
- Use comments sparingly and only when necessary to explain complex logic.

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature-or-fix-name
   ```
2. Make your changes and commit them with a clear, descriptive commit message.
3. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```
   git push origin feature-or-fix-name
   ```
4. Create a pull request from your fork to the main NeuroFlex repository.
5. In the pull request description, clearly explain the changes you've made and their purpose.
6. Link any relevant issues in the pull request description.

## Review Process

- All pull requests will be reviewed by at least one core contributor.
- Reviewers may request changes or ask for clarifications.
- Once approved, your pull request will be merged into the main branch.
- We aim to review and respond to pull requests within 5 business days.
