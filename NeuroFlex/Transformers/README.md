# UnifiedTransformer

The UnifiedTransformer is a versatile transformer architecture that combines elements from BERT, GPT, LLaMA, and T5 models. This implementation aims to provide a flexible framework for various NLP tasks while leveraging the strengths of different transformer architectures.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Backend Support**: Supports PyTorch, JAX, Flax, and Sonnet backends for flexibility in different environments.

2. **Bidirectional Encoding**: Incorporates BERT-like bidirectional context understanding for improved comprehension of input sequences.

3. **Autoregressive Decoding**: Implements GPT-like autoregressive decoding for text generation tasks.

4. **Efficient Training Techniques**: Inspired by LLaMA, the model includes optimizations for handling large datasets and improving training efficiency.

5. **Text-to-Text Framework**: Adopts a T5-like approach for versatile task adaptation, allowing the model to be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks.

6. **Enhanced Attention Mechanism**: Implements an improved multi-head attention mechanism that supports different backends and includes optimizations for better performance.

7. **Flexible Task Adaptation**: Includes methods for fine-tuning on specific tasks such as classification and generation, as well as support for few-shot learning.

## Recent Changes and Optimizations

1. **Backend Abstraction**: Implemented a `FrameworkWrapper` class to abstract backend-specific operations, improving code maintainability and extensibility.

2. **Attention Mechanism Improvements**: Enhanced the `MultiHeadAttention` class to support different backends and include optimizations for mask handling and attention computation.

3. **Generate Method Optimization**: Improved the `generate` method to strictly adhere to the `max_length` parameter and implement more efficient top-k sampling.

4. **Few-Shot Learning Capabilities**: Added a `few_shot_learning` method inspired by GPT-3 for improved performance on tasks with limited examples.

5. **Task-Specific Fine-Tuning**: Implemented methods for easy fine-tuning on classification and generation tasks, with support for different backends.

6. **Positional Encoding Enhancements**: Updated the `PositionalEncoding` class to support different backends and improve efficiency.

7. **Backend-Specific Implementations**: Added specialized implementations for JAX, Flax, and Sonnet backends to leverage platform-specific optimizations.

## Usage

To use the UnifiedTransformer, import the `get_unified_transformer` function and specify the desired backend:

```python
from NeuroFlex.Transformers.unified_transformer import get_unified_transformer

# Create a UnifiedTransformer with the PyTorch backend
model = get_unified_transformer(backend='pytorch', vocab_size=30000)

# Use the model for various NLP tasks
# ...
```

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the documentation and example scripts in the `examples/` directory.

## Future Improvements

- Implement additional optimization techniques for handling even larger datasets
- Extend support for more specialized NLP tasks
- Enhance cross-backend compatibility and performance optimizations
