  - **Predictive Analytics**: Leveraging neural networks to analyze data and make informed predictions in various domains.

### 5. Bayesian Inference
- **Overview**: Bayesian inference is a statistical method that updates the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It provides a framework for reasoning under uncertainty.
- **Key Principles**:
  - **Bayes' Theorem**: The foundation of Bayesian inference, which relates current evidence to prior beliefs to update probabilities.
  - **Prior and Posterior Distributions**: Bayesian inference uses prior distributions to represent initial beliefs and updates them to posterior distributions based on new evidence.
  - **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Bayesian methods provide a systematic approach to reasoning under uncertainty by quantifying uncertainty in terms of probabilities.
- **Relevance to AI**: Bayesian methods are used in AI for probabilistic reasoning, decision-making, and learning from incomplete data, making them valuable for developing robust and reliable AI systems.
- **Potential Applications**:
  - **Machine Learning**: Enhancing model performance by incorporating prior knowledge and updating predictions based on new data.
  - **Robotics**: Improving decision-making and navigation in uncertain environments by using probabilistic reasoning.
  - **Natural Language Processing**: Applying Bayesian methods to improve language models and handle ambiguous or incomplete information.
