# Custom Model Documentation

## Overview
The custom model is designed to incorporate principles from Sakana AI, focusing on evolutionary algorithms and generative AI. It aims to automate research processes, from idea generation to peer review, while maintaining a standalone structure.

## Components

### 1. CustomModel Class
- **Attributes**:
  - `research_ideas`: List to store generated research ideas.
  - `experiments`: List to store executed experiments.
  - `results`: List to store experiment results.

- **Methods**:
  - `generate_research_idea()`: Generates a novel research idea using evolutionary algorithms. Currently returns a placeholder idea.
  - `write_code(idea)`: Writes code to implement the given research idea using LLM. Currently returns a placeholder function.
  - `execute_experiment(code)`: Executes the experiment using the generated code. Currently returns a placeholder result.
  - `summarize_results(results)`: Summarizes the results of the experiments using NLP techniques. Currently returns a placeholder summary.
  - `peer_review(summary)`: Performs an automated peer review of the research using LLM. Currently returns placeholder feedback.
  - `improve_results(feedback)`: Improves results based on peer review feedback. Currently a placeholder.
  - `run_research_cycle(num_iterations)`: Runs a full research cycle, from idea generation to peer review.

### 2. EvolutionaryAlgorithm Class
- **Purpose**: Placeholder for the evolutionary algorithm implementation, used for evolving research ideas and model architectures.
- **Attributes**:
  - `population_size`: Size of the population for the evolutionary algorithm.
- **Methods**:
  - `evolve(fitness_function)`: Placeholder for the evolutionary algorithm.

### 3. GenerativeAIModule Class
- **Purpose**: Placeholder for the generative AI module, used for tasks like code generation and result summarization.
- **Attributes**:
  - `model_type`: Type of generative AI model (e.g., LLM).
- **Methods**:
  - `generate(prompt)`: Generates content based on the given prompt. Currently returns placeholder content.

## Incorporation of Sakana AI Principles
- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: The model includes a placeholder for evolutionary algorithms to generate research ideas and evolve model architectures.
- **Generative AI**: The model uses a generative AI module for code generation and result summarization, inspired by Sakana AI's use of LLMs.
- **Automated Research Process**: The model automates the research cycle, from idea generation to peer review, aligning with Sakana AI's approach.

## Potential Applications
- Automating scientific research processes.
- Enhancing AI model development with adaptive learning.
- Developing AI systems that mimic natural intelligence.

## Future Work
- Implement the evolutionary algorithm for idea generation.
- Develop the generative AI module for code writing and result summarization.
- Create a safe code execution environment for experiments.
- Refine the peer review process to provide meaningful feedback.
- Improve results based on peer review feedback.
