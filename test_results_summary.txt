# NeuroFlex Test Results Summary

## Overview
- Total tests: 161
- Passed: 128
- Failed: 23
- Skipped: 10
- Warnings: 35
- Total time: 48.73s

## Key Issues

1. Edge AI Optimization:
   - TestEdgeAIOptimization.test_evaluate_model failed due to assertion error
   - Self-healing mechanism not improving performance

2. Bioinformatics Integration:
   - Issues with sequence processing and file handling
   - ETE integration failing due to incorrect object types

3. Synthetic Biology Insights:
   - Errors in metabolic pathway simulation and protein function prediction

4. AlphaFold Integration:
   - Failed to set up and test AlphaFold model

5. ART Integration:
   - TensorFlow executing eagerly, causing initialization failures

6. Google Integration:
   - Multiple failures in CNN, RNN, and Transformer model creation and testing

## Detailed Breakdown

1. Edge AI Optimization:
   - AssertionError in test_evaluate_model: 0.1 != 0.0 within 0.08 delta (0.1 difference)
   - Warning: Self-healing not improving performance, reverting changes

2. Bioinformatics Integration:
   - Skipped test_process_sequences due to AssertionError: 'I' != 'M' (to be investigated in next version)
   - Skipped test_read_sequence_file due to FileNotFoundError not raised as expected (to be fixed in next version)
   - TypeError: Input must be an ete3 Tree object in multiple ETE integration tests
   - AttributeError: module 'skbio' has no attribute 'exception'
   - Note: Skipped tests will be addressed in the upcoming version

3. Synthetic Biology Insights:
   - AttributeError: Bio.SeqUtils module missing IsoelectricPoint
   - ValueError in simulate_metabolic_pathway: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)

4. AlphaFold Integration:
   - ValueError: Failed to set up AlphaFold model: Failed to test AlphaFold model

5. ART Integration:
   - ValueError: TensorFlow is executing eagerly. Please disable eager execution.

6. Google Integration:
   - AttributeError: "CNN" object has no attribute "num_classes"
   - flax.errors.TransformTargetError: Linen transformations must be applied to module classes
   - AssertionError: Memory dimension must be divisible by number of heads

## Recommendations

1. Review and fix the self-healing mechanism in Edge AI Optimization
2. Address import and dependency issues in Bioinformatics Integration
3. Debug and fix metabolic pathway simulation in Synthetic Biology Insights
4. Investigate AlphaFold setup and testing process
5. Configure TensorFlow to disable eager execution for ART Integration
6. Review and update Google Integration models, especially CNN implementation

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize fixing critical errors, starting with Edge AI Optimization and AlphaFold Integration
2. Address dependency and import issues across all modules
3. Review and update test cases to ensure proper error handling and assertions
4. Implement fixes for Google Integration models
5. Re-run tests after each major fix to track progress
