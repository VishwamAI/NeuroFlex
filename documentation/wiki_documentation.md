## Introduction
NeuroFlex is an advanced neural network framework that integrates cutting-edge technologies for developing, training, and deploying state-of-the-art machine learning models. This wiki provides comprehensive documentation for users and developers, covering everything from basic setup to advanced features and troubleshooting.

## Installation
To install NeuroFlex, use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install neuroflex
```

For development installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/NeuroFlex.git
cd NeuroFlex
pip install -e .
```

## Core Components
NeuroFlex consists of several core components, each designed to work seamlessly within the NeuroFlex ecosystem:

1. **Neural Network Models**: Supports a wide range of architectures including CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs.
   - Example: `model = NeuroFlex(features=[64, 32, 10], use_cnn=True, use_rnn=True)`

2. **Reinforcement Learning Module**: Tools for developing and training RL agents.
   - Key classes: `ReplayBuffer`, `RLEnvironment`
   - Example: `env = RLEnvironment("CartPole-v1")`

3. **AlphaFold Integration**: Protein structure prediction capabilities.
   - Usage: `alphafold = AlphaFoldIntegration()`

4. **Mathematical Solvers**: Various mathematical operations and optimizations.
   - Example: `solver = MathSolver()`

5. **Ethical AI Framework**: Ensures responsible AI development.

## Usage Guide
1. **Basic Model Setup**:
   ```python
   from neuroflex import NeuroFlex

   model = NeuroFlex(
       features=[64, 32, 10],
       use_cnn=True,
       use_rnn=True,
       use_gan=True,
       fairness_constraint=0.1,
       use_quantum=True,
       use_alphafold=True,
       backend='pytorch'
   )
   ```

2. **Loading Data**:
   ```python
   model.load_bioinformatics_data("path/to/data.fasta")
   ```

3. **Training**:
   ```python
   trained_state, trained_model = train_neuroflex_model(model, train_data, val_data)
   ```

4. **Making Predictions**:
   (To be added)

## Advanced Features
1. **Multi-Backend Integration**:
   - Supports PyTorch and TensorFlow
   - Usage: Specify `backend='pytorch'` or `backend='tensorflow'` in NeuroFlex initialization

2. **Quantum Neural Networks**:
   - Integration with quantum computing frameworks
   - Enable with `use_quantum=True` in NeuroFlex initialization

3. **Brain-Computer Interface Integration**:
   - (Detailed information to be added)

## Troubleshooting
1. **Installation Issues**:
   - Ensure you have the latest version of pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
   - Check for conflicting dependencies: `pip check`

2. **Runtime Errors**:
   - "Model is not trained": Ensure you've called the training function before making predictions
   - "Bioinformatics data not loaded": Call `load_bioinformatics_data()` before training

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - If experiencing slow performance, try adjusting batch size or learning rate
   - For memory issues, consider using a smaller model or reducing input size
