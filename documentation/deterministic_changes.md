# Ensuring Deterministic Behavior in Model Evaluation

## Overview
To address the inconsistency in test results for the `evaluate_model` method within the `EdgeAIOptimization` class, changes were made to ensure deterministic behavior. This document outlines the modifications implemented to achieve consistent and reproducible evaluation results.

## Changes Implemented

### Random Seed Settings
- **NumPy Seed**: Set the random seed for NumPy using `np.random.seed(42)`.
- **PyTorch Seed**: Set the random seed for PyTorch using `torch.manual_seed(42)`.

### PyTorch Deterministic Configuration
- **Deterministic Operations**: Enabled deterministic operations in PyTorch by setting `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True`.
- **Benchmarking**: Disabled benchmarking in PyTorch by setting `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False` to ensure consistent performance across runs.

## Impact
These changes ensure that the `evaluate_model` method produces consistent results across multiple evaluations, eliminating variability due to non-deterministic operations. This is particularly important for testing and validation purposes, where reproducibility is crucial.

## Conclusion
By implementing these changes, the `evaluate_model` method now provides reliable and consistent performance metrics, contributing to the overall robustness and reliability of the Edge AI product.
