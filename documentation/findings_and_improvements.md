4. AlphaFold Integration Challenges:
   - Current installed version is AlphaFold 2.0.0, which lacks certain modules present in newer versions.
   - Unable to upgrade to AlphaFold 2.3.2 due to package unavailability.
   - The `alphafold.model.tf` module is missing in the installed version, causing import errors.
   - GitHub repository structure for AlphaFold includes a `tf` directory under `alphafold/model/`, which is not present in our installation.

## Proposed Improvements
