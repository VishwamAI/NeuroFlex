- **Message**: Line search cannot locate an adequate point after MAXLS function and gradient evaluations.
- **Location**: Various tests, primarily in `math_solvers.py`
- **Potential Causes**:
  1. Error in function or gradient evaluation
  2. Rounding error dominates computation

- **Location**: `edge_ai_optimization.py`
- **Potential Causes**:
  1. Ineffective self-healing strategies
  2. Inconsistent model performance

## Other Warnings
