# Comprehensive Documentation on Cognitive Frameworks for AI

## 1. Modular Cognition Framework (MCF)
- **Overview**: The Modular Cognition Framework (MCF) is a theoretical model that suggests cognition is composed of distinct, specialized modules that process information independently.
- **Key Principles**: Modularity, domain-specific processing, encapsulation.
- **Relevance to AI**: MCF provides a blueprint for designing AI systems with specialized components that can work together to achieve complex tasks.
- **Potential Applications**: AI systems with modular architectures for tasks like perception, reasoning, and learning.

## 2. Embodied Cognition
- **Overview**: Embodied Cognition posits that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in the body's interactions with the world.
- **Key Principles**: Sensorimotor coupling, environmental interaction, action-perception loops.
- **Relevance to AI**: Highlights the importance of physical embodiment and interaction in developing intelligent systems.
- **Potential Applications**: Robotics, human-computer interaction, virtual reality.

## 3. Situated Cognition
- **Overview**: Situated Cognition emphasizes that cognition is influenced by the context in which it occurs, including social, cultural, and physical environments.
- **Key Principles**: Context-dependence, social interaction, cultural influence.
- **Relevance to AI**: Encourages the design of AI systems that can adapt to and learn from their environments.
- **Potential Applications**: Context-aware systems, adaptive learning environments, social robotics.

## 4. Connectionist Models
- **Overview**: Connectionist Models, also known as neural networks, are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the brain.
- **Key Principles**: Distributed representations, parallel processing, learning through experience.
- **Relevance to AI**: Form the basis of many modern AI systems, enabling tasks like pattern recognition and decision-making.
- **Potential Applications**: Image and speech recognition, natural language processing, autonomous systems.

## 5. Bayesian Inference
- **Overview**: Bayesian Inference is a statistical method that updates the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.
- **Key Principles**: Prior probability, likelihood, posterior probability.
- **Relevance to AI**: Provides a framework for probabilistic reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty.
- **Potential Applications**: Predictive modeling, anomaly detection, decision support systems.

### Bayesian Inference Module Implementation
- **Integration**: The Bayesian Inference module has been integrated into the standalone cognitive model, allowing for probabilistic reasoning and belief updating.
- **Functionality**: The module initializes prior probabilities, updates beliefs based on observations, and makes predictions for new data.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive tests have been conducted to ensure the module's functionality and integration with the standalone model.
