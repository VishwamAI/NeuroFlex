## Installation

```bash
pip install neuroflex
```

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Import NeuroFlex**

```python
from neuroflex import NeuroFlexNN, train_model, create_neuroflex_nn
```

2. **Define Your Model**

```python
model = create_neuroflex_nn(
    features=[64, 32, 10],
    input_shape=(1, 28, 28, 1),
    output_shape=(1, 10),
    use_cnn=True,
    conv_dim=2,
    backend='tensorflow'  # or 'jax' for JAX/Flax backend
)
```

3. **Train Your Model**

```python
trained_state, trained_model = train_model(
    model, train_data, val_data,
    num_epochs=10, batch_size=32, learning_rate=1e-3
)
```

4. **Make Predictions**

```python
predictions = trained_model(test_data)
```

## Advanced Usage

### TensorFlow Convolutions

```python
from neuroflex import TensorFlowConvolutions

tf_conv = TensorFlowConvolutions(
    features=(32, 64, 128),
    input_shape=(1, 28, 28, 1),
    conv_dim=2  # Use 3 for 3D convolutions
)
model = tf_conv.create_model()
```

### JAX/Flax and TensorFlow Compatibility

```python
from neuroflex.utils import convert_array

jax_array = jax.random.uniform(jax.random.PRNGKey(0), shape=(1, 28, 28, 1))
tf_tensor = convert_array(jax_array, 'tensorflow')
```

### Adversarial Training

```python
from neuroflex import adversarial_training

perturbed_data = adversarial_training(model, params, input_data, epsilon=0.1, step_size=0.01)
```

## Testing

We have developed comprehensive pytest tests for all components, including the TensorFlow integration. To run the tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Key test files:
- `test_neuroflex_nn.py`: Tests for the core NeuroFlexNN functionality
