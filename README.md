# NeuroFlex: Advanced Neural Network with Interpretability, Generalization, Robustness, and Fairness

## Overview

NeuroFlex is an advanced neural network implementation using JAX and Flax, designed to address key challenges in modern machine learning: interpretability, generalization, robustness, and fairness. This project showcases state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies for creating more transparent, reliable, and ethical AI systems.

## Features

1. **Advanced Neural Network Architecture**
   - Flexible feedforward neural network with customizable layers
   - Dropout for improved generalization
   - Fairness constraint integration

2. **Interpretability**
   - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretation
   - Feature importance visualization

3. **Generalization Techniques**
   - Dropout regularization
   - Data augmentation
   - Early stopping

4. **Robustness**
   - Adversarial training using FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method)
   - Epsilon parameter for controlling perturbation strength

5. **Fairness Considerations**
   - Demographic parity constraint
   - Bias mitigation using Reweighing algorithm
   - Fairness metrics evaluation (disparate impact, equal opportunity difference)

6. **Training Process**
   - Customizable training loop with batch processing
   - Validation accuracy monitoring
   - Learning rate adjustment

## Usage

To use NeuroFlex, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   from advanced_nn import AdvancedNN, train_model, evaluate_fairness, interpret_model
   ```

2. Define your model architecture:
   ```python
   model = AdvancedNN([64, 32, 10], activation=nn.relu, dropout_rate=0.5, fairness_constraint=0.1)
   ```

3. Prepare your data, including sensitive attributes for fairness considerations.

4. Train the model:
   ```python
   trained_state = train_model(model, train_data, val_data, num_epochs=10, batch_size=32,
                               learning_rate=1e-3, fairness_constraint=0.1, epsilon=0.1)
   ```

5. Evaluate fairness:
   ```python
   fairness_metrics = evaluate_fairness(trained_state, val_data)
   print("Fairness metrics:", fairness_metrics)
   ```

6. Interpret model decisions:
   ```python
   shap_values = interpret_model(model, trained_state.params, val_data['image'][:100])
   ```

## Requirements

- JAX
- Flax
- Optax
- NumPy
- SHAP
- AIF360 (for fairness metrics and bias mitigation)

## Future Work

- Integration of more advanced architectures (e.g., Transformers, GNNs)
- Expansion of interpretability methods
- Enhanced robustness against various types of adversarial attacks
- More comprehensive fairness metrics and mitigation techniques
