# NeuroFlex: Advanced Neural Network Framework

NeuroFlex is a cutting-edge neural network framework built on JAX and Flax, designed to address key challenges in modern machine learning: interpretability, generalization, robustness, and fairness. This project showcases state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies for creating more transparent, reliable, and ethical AI systems.

## Features

- Advanced neural network architectures (CNN, RNN, LSTM, GAN)
- Reinforcement learning capabilities
- Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) integration
- Fairness constraints and bias mitigation
- Adversarial training for improved robustness
- Interpretability tools (SHAP)
- 2D and 3D convolution support
- Data augmentation techniques

## Installation

```bash
pip install neuroflex
```

## Quick Start

```python
from neuroflex import NeuroFlexNN, train_model

# Define your model
model = NeuroFlexNN(
    features=[64, 32, 10],
    use_cnn=True,
    use_rnn=True,
    fairness_constraint=0.1
)

# Train your model
trained_state, trained_model = train_model(
    model, train_data, val_data,
    num_epochs=10, batch_size=32, learning_rate=1e-3
)
```
