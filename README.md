- Updated deprecated `jax.tree_map` to `jax.tree.map` for compatibility with the latest JAX version
- These changes ensure proper functioning of the LSTM block within the neural network architecture

## Usage

To use NeuroFlex, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
   ```python
   from advanced_nn import AdvancedNN, train_model, evaluate_fairness, interpret_model
   ```

2. Define your model architecture:
   ```python
   model = AdvancedNN(
       features=[64, 32, 10],
       activation=nn.relu,
       dropout_rate=0.5,
       fairness_constraint=0.1,
       use_cnn=True,
       use_rnn=True,
       use_lstm=True,
       use_gan=True
   )
   ```

3. Prepare your data, including sensitive attributes for fairness considerations.

4. Train the model:
   ```python
   trained_state = train_model(model, train_data, val_data, num_epochs=10, batch_size=32,
                               learning_rate=1e-3, fairness_constraint=0.1, epsilon=0.1)
   ```

5. Evaluate fairness:
   ```python
   fairness_metrics = evaluate_fairness(trained_state, val_data)
   print("Fairness metrics:", fairness_metrics)
   ```

6. Interpret model decisions:
   ```python
   shap_values = interpret_model(model, trained_state.params, val_data['image'][:100])
   ```
