## Installation

```bash
pip install neuroflex
```

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Import NeuroFlex**

```python
from neuroflex import NeuroFlexNN, train_model, AlphaFoldIntegration
```

2. **Define Your Model**

```python
model = NeuroFlexNN(
    features=[64, 32, 10],
    use_cnn=True,
    use_rnn=True,
    fairness_constraint=0.1,
    use_quantum=True,
    use_alphafold=True
)
```

3. **Initialize AlphaFold Integration**

```python
alphafold = AlphaFoldIntegration()
alphafold.setup_model(model_params={'max_recycling': 3})
predicted_structure = alphafold.predict_structure()
```

4. **Train Your Model**

```python
trained_state, trained_model = train_model(
    model, train_data, val_data,
    num_epochs=10, batch_size=32, learning_rate=1e-3,
    alphafold_structure=predicted_structure
)
```

5. **Analyze Results**

```python
plddt_scores = alphafold.get_plddt_scores()
predicted_aligned_error = alphafold.get_predicted_aligned_error()

print(f"Average pLDDT score: {plddt_scores.mean()}")
print(f"Average predicted aligned error: {predicted_aligned_error.mean()}")
```

## Advanced Usage

### Quantum Neural Networks
