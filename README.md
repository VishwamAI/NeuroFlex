```

## Environment Setup

NeuroFlex supports multiple operating systems and Python versions:

- Ubuntu
- Windows
- macOS
- Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12

To set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/neuroflex/neuroflex.git`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv neuroflex-env`
3. Activate the environment:
   - Ubuntu/macOS: `source neuroflex-env/bin/activate`
   - Windows: `neuroflex-env\Scripts\activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Quick Start

```python
from neuroflex import NeuroFlexNN, train_model

# Define your model
model = NeuroFlexNN(
    features=[64, 32, 10],
    use_cnn=True,
    use_rnn=True,
    fairness_constraint=0.1,
    use_quantum=True  # Enable quantum neural network
)

# Train your model
trained_state, trained_model = train_model(
    model, train_data, val_data,
    num_epochs=10, batch_size=32, learning_rate=1e-3
)
```

## Testing

To run tests for different Python versions and operating systems:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
