# MODEL.py Update Plan

## Summary
The `MODEL.py` file needs to be updated to incorporate all features from the NeuroFlex project. This includes updating import statements, adding new modules, and ensuring integration with core components and specialized modules.

## Import Statements
Update import statements to include all necessary modules:
```python
from .core_neural_networks import *
from .advanced_models import *
from .generative_models import *
from .Transformers import *
from .quantum_neural_networks import *
from .bci_integration import *
from .cognitive_architectures import *
from .scientific_domains import *
from .edge_ai import *
from .Prompt_Agent import *
from .utils import *
from .ai_ethics import *
```

## Class and Method Updates
- **NeuroFlex Class**: Update to include methods for all the new features.
  - Add methods for BCI processing, cognitive architecture integration, edge AI optimization, and prompt agent behavior.
  - Ensure compatibility with core components and specialized modules.

- **SelfCuringAlgorithm Class**: Ensure it includes all necessary diagnostic and healing methods.

## New Features to Include
- **BCI Integration**: Add methods for processing brain-computer interface data.
- **Cognitive Architectures**: Integrate advanced cognitive models and architectures.
- **Edge AI**: Include methods for edge AI optimization and neuromorphic computing.
- **Prompt Agent**: Add methods for agentic behavior and prompt-based learning.

## Version Update
- Update the version number to reflect the new features and improvements.

## Package-Level Functions
- Add any necessary package-level functions or variables.

## Testing and Validation
- Ensure compatibility with the full NeuroFlex project.
- Consider updating tests to reflect the changes made in `MODEL.py`.

## Example Usage
- Update the example usage section to demonstrate the updated model's capabilities.

## Next Steps
- Review the plan with the user and obtain approval before executing the changes.
- Once approved, implement the changes in `MODEL.py`.
- Create a pull request for the changes and notify the user for review.
